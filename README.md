- 👋 Hi, I’m @mullaghori
- 👀 I’m interested in learning different languages, currently my focus is on python and in future I will try to learn more languages. 
- 🌱 I’m ~~currently~~ learning python and start my BS Computer Science degree in August 2021.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different types of projects and learn as much as i can.
- 📫 You can leave here a message for me or you can reach me also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/javed.MGI) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mullaghori)
- 🐍 ~~I'm also running a blog about Python, [Creative Kode](https://www.blogger.com/blog/posts/7027373473707040583?hl=en).~~ <mark>The Blog is discontinued, because of some issues</mark> You can check out my posts there!
- 💻 My priorities changes for now, as i have jumped into learning web development, so HTML and CSS will be my first 2 languages to learn.
